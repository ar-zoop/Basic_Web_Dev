                <h2>Success in Competitive Exams is
                    Getting Harder and Harder Every Year</h2>
                <p>Every year, more and more students appear for each competitive exam. </p>
                <p>Every year, there are new coaching institutes.</p>
                <p>Every year, more and more students join coaching institutes and work hard.</p>
                <p>The result?</p>
                <p>Getting success in competitive exams in India is becoming harder and harder every year.</p>
                <p>Which means that less and less people get success.</p>
                <p>The competition for jobs is even harder because the government jobs are limited and there are
                    various reservations ... making it harder for everyone.</p>
                <p style="text-align:center"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/bold-prediction.jpg"></p>
                <p>In most tough competitive exams, out of every 100,000 who appear in the exams, only 200 to 1,000 get
                    success.</p>
                <p>In other words, out of every 100,000 as many as 99,000 to 99,800 fail.</p>
                <p>For example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>About 180 join as IAS out of 10,00,000 (10 lakh) civil services aspirants.</li>
                    <li>About 1,300 join IIM out of 2,00,000 (2 lakh) CAT aspirants.</li>
                    <li>About 10,000 join IIT out of 15,00,000 (15 lakh) IIT-JEE aspirants.</li>
                    <li>About 60,000 join MBBS out of 11,00,000 (11 lakh) NEET aspirants.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>No coaching institute wants you to find out these facts. <b>Mathematics tells us that a person
                        has
                        a
                        higher chance of winning a lottery than getting success in IAS</b>.</p>

                <h2>"Exam Success" is Extremely Important for Success, Respect, Pride, and Wealth for the Middle Class</h2>
				<p>Students work hard and their families spend a lot of money for the studies and coaching.</p>
                <p>The families have hopes and dreams of success, pride, happiness.</p>
                <p>But their dreams are crashed.</p>
                <p>Their hard work is wasted.</p>
                <p>And, the family cannot understand what happened.
                    Why their loved son or daughter failed despite hard work and coaching?</p>
                <p>The question is, "What can you do?"</p>
                <p>The first thing to
                    understand
                    is that your coaching is not going to give you success. Don't get me wrong.
                    Coaching is useful. But nothing more. So, you have to do something extra to prepare better
                    than
                    others ... to use your time more effectively ... to study with concentration ...
                    to learn and remember more in less time.</p>
                <p>Our mind machine has been helping thousands of students do exactly so for various exams
                    including
                    <b>IAS,
                        UPSC, IIM, IIT, NEET, SSC, Bank, State PSC, 10th and 12th Board, Defence, NTSE, BITSAT, KVPY,
                        Olympiads, GATE</b>,
                    and even <b>certifications</b> for various professions.</p>
                <p>It helps you study every subject including <b>General Studies, English, History, Maths,
                        Physics,
                        and
                        all other subjects</b>.</p>
                <h2>It is a Tool</h2>
				<p>The mind machine is like a tool that amplifies your effort in whatever you study.</p>
                <p>What is surprising is that many executives and business owners use it for stress management
                    and
                    relaxation while religious gurus use it for meditation and spiritual practice.</p>
                <p>If you are a student, first you'll benefit by getting more marks and higher rank,
                    and then once you are in job or business, you'll benefit from stress-buster and meditation
                    programs.</p>
                <p>Imagine ...</p>

                <h2>How Will Your Life Change Once You Can Study Easily with Better Concentration?
                </h2>

                <p>With mind machine, you study better with sharper concentration. And you remember more of what
                    you
                    study. As a
                    result, you get more marks and higher rank in the exams.</p>

                <p>It works in 2 ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It changes your brainwaves in just 7 minutes.</li>
                    <li>It programs your subconscious mind to build positive
                        empowering beliefs and overcome negative, limiting beliefs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are no techniques to learn and practice.</p>
                <p>It works automatically without you needing will power or determination.</p>
                <p>All you have to do is put on headphones and eye-glasses, and run a program.</p>
                <p>Therefore, you study better with sharper concentration, remember better, and get more marks
                    in
                    exams.</p>

                <p class="praise2">The Mind Machine is a wonderful motivator. I got it on Friday.
                    When I first used the [program] &quot;Enter the ... Learning State&quot;, I felt that I
                    went into a relaxed state ...
                </p>
                <p class="praise2">After the first usage the learning effect was there for more
                    than 2 hours. After that, I slept for the day. During those 2 hours, I completed
                    one book &quot;Quantum Mechanics 1: The Breakthrough&quot; by G. Venkatraman.

                    During the weekend, I finished 3 books. A novel by
                    John Grisham &quot;Street Lawyer&quot; and &quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything...by
                    Bill Bryson&quot;. Reading is fun with #2 and #3 ... </p>
                <p class="praise2">I can&#39;t wait to complete my first month with the machine
                    and meet the genius in me. I guess I already have had a glimpse of my side. </p>

                    for
                    his
                    wife

                    was
                    suffering a lot of pain due to cancer, and to his surprise she got much pain relief. That's
                    when
                    Dr
                    Vyas
                    decided to
                    do PhD to see if the mind machine could help students to get more marks in exams.</p>

                <p>The book asks this question:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Take breaks. Studying for too long without breaks can wear you down.</li>
                    <li>Don't worry about the tough ones.</li>
                    <li>Don't procrastinate. ...</li>

                    <li>... many more ...</li>
                    <li><b>Hardly anybody tells</b> to focus on concentration (despite students wasting time on social

                <p>If you spend enough time on the Internet, you'll find tips that are opposite of one another.

                <p>So, to try your best for success, the only practical way is to find
                    one thing that others are neglecting but will push you ahead of others to give you success,

                    powerful
                    experience. I
                    felt so
                    relaxed and things appeared clear. It felt like I was thinking better.
                    So, when I returned to India to help students, I purchased a mind machine and brought it
                    with
                    me.</p>
                <p>We spent over 2 years to design and build our first mind machine just for students.
                    Our first version was developed during 1992-93 by a PhD student in IIT Delhi, who later did
                    important
                    work
                    for
                    Silicon Graphics (a computer company in California).</p>

                <p>It is designed for rough use and built to last many, many years without any problem.</p>
                <p>If we develop any new programs for the mind machine, they will all be available free to all
                    mind

                    <h2>Most Mind Machines Change the Brainwaves But <u>Only Our Mind Machine Offers This Big
                            Benefit for Students</u>...</h2>

                        <small>A recent search on Amazon.com for "light sound mind machines" showed these.
                        </small>

                    </p>
                    <p>Our mind machine is similar to many available in USA in the sense that all of them change
                        the
                        brainwaves.</p>
                    <p><b>Our mind machine offers ONE BIG BENEFIT</b> that it is optimized for students for
                        learning, so it
                        changes the brainwaves to
                        those that are ideal for learning and to those that are best for mind programming. And
                        that
                        means
                        the
                        users
                        don't have to research which brainwaves are the best for them. </p>
                    <p>For example, student programs (for faster learning and exam mastery) have brainwaves that
                        are
                        best
                        for
                        learning.
                        And programs for meditation have brainwaves that are best for different levels of
                        mediation. </p>

                    <p>In addition, we've made other important changes to make it even better for students in
                        India.
                        For
                        example,
                        our glasses are practically non-breakable (because there are no over-the-ears
                        sticks).</p>
                </div>


                <h3 style="text-align:center">But Not for Everybody</h3>
                <p>It's not for those undergoing treatment with a psychiatrist or psychologist.</p>
                <p>But it is a powerful tool to help normal students do better and is highly recommended for
                    students of
                    9th class to college and even PhDs as well as professionals who have to appear in exams as

            <h1>Benefit from the Power of 6 Mind Technologies</h1>
            <p>Here is brief overview of the mind technologies
                used in creating these audio programs. </p>


            <h2>Mind Technology #1. <br>
			DAPS<sup style="font-weight:normal;font-size:16;">
                    TM</sup><br>
                (Dual Auto Peripheral Suggestions)</h2>
            <p>
                <img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/megabrain-s.jpg"
                     align="right" style="float: left">Let me now tell you about another technology called
                DAPS
                (Dual Auto Peripheral Suggestions). It uses two separate
                stories, one for each ear. Here is how the great writer
                Michael Hutchison in his now classic book &quot;Mega Brain&quot; wrote
                about using two stories method. (By the way, I met Michael
                in California in 1991 and purchased my first mind machine
                from him for US $329.)</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="praise">
                <img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/michael_hutchison.jpg" align="left"
                     width="64" height="86" style="float: left">&quot;I
                first heard it in a float tank, where, having donned stereo
                headphones, I heard calm voices against a background of
                stately, soaring synthesizer music, gently guiding me into
                a deeply relaxed state. Then the soundtrack divided and
                I heard a separate voice in each ear, each voice narrating
                a completely different fairy-tale--charming stories of wizards,
                magic cities, intergalactic zoos, and mystic shoemakers.
                &quot;This simultaneous input overloads the conscious mind,&quot;
                says Glauberman, &quot;because there is simply too much information
                to process consciously.&quot; Unable to focus on either story,
                I found, your conscious mind tends to let go or turn off.
                When the half-hour session was over, I seemed to awaken (though
                I knew I hadn&#39;t been asleep), feeling like I had had a delightful
                experience, though I couldn&#39;t quite remember just what the
                experience had been.&quot;</p>
            <ul>
                <p></p>
            </ul>
            <p><u>You hear a different story in each ear</u> in my voice
                that makes artful use of language, neuro linguistic programming,
                Ericksonian techniques to <b>immediately produce measurable
                    relaxation</b> in you while building positive, powerful,
                empowering beliefs that produce dramatic breakthrough results
                for you. I load the tales with variety of powerful suggestions
                that are best for students, in such artful way that the
                suggestions remain indirect and are seemingly part of the story,
                so they go unnoticed. And, because the
                conscious mind can at best focus on one story at a time,
                it usually gives up and stops paying conscious attention,
                and as a result, most of the stories and the empowering
                messages hidden within them bypass the conscious mind completely,
                entering the unconscious mind. This is the most powerful method of belief change because it
                really works and it is effortless
                on the part of the listener.</p>

                    TM</sup></h2>
            <p>Before I give you
                scientific explanation, first let me show you what Osho,
                one of the greatest gurus ever, said about &quot;mind technology&quot;
                in the book <b>Meditation: The First and Last Freedom</b>:</p>
            <p class="praise">
                &quot;... these high-tech mechanisms can be of tremendous use
                in the right hands. <b>They can help create the kinds of
                    waves in your mind</b> so that you start feeling relaxed,
                as if half asleep ... thoughts are disappearing and a moment
                comes that everything becomes silent in you. That is the
                moment when the waves are those of deep sleep. You will
                not be aware of this deep sleep, but after 10 minutes, when
                you are unplugged from the machine, <b>you will see the
                    effects</b>: you are calm, quiet, peaceful, no worry, no
                tension; life seems to be more playful and joyous. One feels
                as if one has had an inner bath. Your whole being is calm
                and cool.<br>
                <b>With machines, things are very certain</b>, because they
                don&#39;t depend on any doing of yours. <br>
                ... but these machines can certainly <b>create within 10
                    minutes a possibility </b>that you may not be able to create
                in years of effort.&quot;</p>

            <p><u>If you play sound of 500 Hz in one ear and 510 Hz
                    in the other ear</u>, your brain &quot;hears&quot; the sound of frequency
                that is the difference of the two frequencies, i.e., 510-500
                = 10 Hz. This sound is called binaural beat and it does
                not actually exist in the environment around us, but it
                is only in the mind. Students who study Physics know it
                is similar to &quot;resonance&quot;. </p>
            <p>When this happens, researchers are able to measure increased
                levels of bilateral synchronized brain wave activity at
                the frequency of the binaural beat. </p>


            <hr>

            <h2>Our Brainwave Technology is Totally Different from Binaural Technology in Videos on YouTube</h2>
            <p><b>Brainwave Sync Tonal Matrix</b>, the mind technology
                developed by us and used in our mind machine, uses <i>binaural
                    beats</i> technology, but it is far more complex and advanced
                than just using 500Hz and 510 Hz for the two ears.</p>
            <p>The inventor of this technology Robert Monroe gave only part explanation similar to above
                and that misled thousands to create binaural beats audio/video (thousands are on YouTube) that
                don't
                work well and even cause headache.</p>
            <p>What surprised me what that the binaural audio programs created by Late Michael Hutchison gave me
                headache.
                By the way, Michael is the bestselling author of "Mega Brain" and "Mega Brain Power", two books
                that
                brought the brain technologies to general public. Michael later became my friend and I published
                his books (which had gone out of print) on Amazon.
                It was only much later that I understand what Robert Monroe had kept as secret.</p>
            <h3>It Took Our Institute 12 Years to Perfect Our Technology</h3>
            <p>You perhaps know that we created Mind Power Music in 1992, but it was only in 2004 that we
                perfected the binaural beats technology described above. And, that was the first time we
                launched it.</p>

            <p>The end-result is that while most binaural beat programs give headache, ours is among the best 3
                that I like including those by Robert Monroe and Master Charles.</p>

                        <br>This is the best choice because this puts you ahead of other students. Did you realize that most of the students don't know about the mind machine.
